# time

The first primitive of the universe.

Before there were thoughts, there was time — because a thought is meaningless
outside of the moment it was born (see [`README.md`](./README.md)).

## How time works here

Time moves in **ticks**. One tick lasts `SNAPSHOT_DURATION_SECONDS` (a
fundamental constant — see [`CONSTANTS`](./CONSTANTS)), currently 600 seconds =
ten minutes.

- `t=0` is the **big bang** — the root commit of this repository.
- Every tick, the universe records itself: it stages whatever changed, commits
  a snapshot authored by **Satori**, and pushes the copy to `origin`.
- The commit is allowed to be empty. Time passes whether or not anything
  changed, so even a quiet tick leaves a mark. The git log is therefore a
  literal, tick-by-tick timeline of the universe's existence.

The current tick is not stored — it is *derived*:
`t = (now − big_bang) / SNAPSHOT_DURATION_SECONDS`.
Time is computed from the distance to the beginning, not counted by hand.

## The mechanism

Time is observed by [`observe.py`](./observe.py). One snapshot — one tick — is
the work of its `snapshot()` function. Take one by hand:

```sh
python3 observe.py snapshot
```

A cron job calls `observe.py snapshot` once every ten minutes, so the universe
advances on its own (see `crontab -l`). Running `python3 observe.py` with no
arguments installs that heartbeat, starts the daemon, and takes a first
snapshot — so to begin the universe, that one command is all you need.
